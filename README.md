# What's new in update v1.1?
- Roles reworked
  - Innocents can now grab clues aswell.
  - Clues now need to be grabbed then delivered to the investigation centre
  - Clues to find increase from 3 to 5
  - These changes naturally buff the traitor role, which used to be the weakes role

NOTE: This version had to be created a second time since it got corrupted, which means i had to start again from the old version (v1.0) and lose my flow. (So expect alot of bugs)
